# MemoryStitcher Project - Current State

## Project Overview
MemoryStitcher is a mobile-first application with web support that uses AI-powered conversations to help users capture their personal and family stories in an engaging, easy-to-use format. The app transforms chat-based interactions into beautifully crafted narratives that can be shared among family members.

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed
1. **Project Structure**: Set up the basic React Native Web project structure with TypeScript
2. **Directory Organization**: Created organized directory structure for components, screens, services, etc.
3. **Dependencies**: Installed necessary dependencies including:
   - React Native Web
   - Supabase for authentication and database
   - React Navigation for routing
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
4. **Authentication**: Implemented authentication screens:
   - Landing page
   - Sign In
   - Sign Up
   - Forgot Password
5. **Navigation**: Set up navigation structure with:
   - Auth Navigator
   - Main Navigator
   - Onboarding Navigator
   - Root Navigator
6. **Context Providers**: Created context providers for:
   - Authentication
   - Theme (light/dark mode)
   - App state (user data, stories)
7. **Database Schema**: Created SQL script for Supabase database setup
8. **Web Configuration**: Set up web-specific files (index.html, manifest.json)
9. **Deployment Configuration**: Created netlify.toml for Netlify deployment

### In Progress
1. **Running the App**: We've started the development server with `npm run web` but haven't fully tested the app yet
2. **GitHub Integration**: We've committed all changes but are having issues pushing to the GitHub repository due to authentication issues

### Next Steps
1. **Push to GitHub**: Resolve GitHub authentication issues to push the code
2. **Complete Remaining Screens**:
   - Stories list screen
   - Story detail screen
   - Story creation screen
   - Profile screen
3. **Implement AI Integration**: Set up the AI conversation system using OpenAI API
4. **Database Integration**: Implement the actual database operations with Supabase
5. **Testing**: Test all features and fix any bugs
6. **Deployment**: Deploy to Netlify

## Technical Details

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables are set up:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key (recently added)

### Supabase Integration
- Authentication is set up with email/password
- Database schema includes tables for:
  - memory_files: Stores user's memory file data
  - stories: Stores user's stories
  - story_conversations: Stores raw conversation data
  - categories: Stores story categories

### UI Implementation
- Using a color scheme based on the existing memorystitcher.com site:
  - Primary color: #8B5A2B (brown)
  - Secondary color: #F5F0E8 (light beige)
- Responsive design for both mobile and web
- Support for light and dark themes

### Current Limitations
- Only basic authentication is implemented (email/password)
- AI conversation system is not yet implemented
- Family sharing features are not yet implemented
- No actual database operations are implemented yet
